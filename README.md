# Hopper_Robot #
This repository contains code being used to run the *Hopper Robot* project in the Neuroscience and Robotics Lab at Northwestern University.

## Project Description ##
Project aims to integrate physics models and control methodologies for enhanced robotic legged locomotion on yielding terrain. Currently, robotic performace on natural substrates such as sand, snow, and grass is limited. Mechanical reactions of the earth exibit great spatial variation, imposing challenges to robotic design and control. Legged robots with greater mobility on natural terrain have applications in many areas, including: search and rescue, agricultural, planetary and space exploration, etc. The funding for this project is provided by NASA.

## Apparatus ##
The apparatus for this project collects data used to characterize the material response and will be used to test controllers and designs that take advantage of these material properies.
